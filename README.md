# Compomix

**Compomix** is a Python tool that calculates and visualizes the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced composites using the modified Halpin-Tsai and Kelly-Tyson models. It's designed with silk-PGA biocomposites in mind but can be easily adapted for other fiber/matrix combinations.

## Features
- Estimates effective elastic modulus with random orientation correction.
- Computes tensile strength using Kelly-Tyson equation.
- Includes critical length estimation.
- Outputs Poissonâ€™s ratio and density.
- Generates two clean plots for analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sepehr-sohrabi/Compomix.git
cd Compomix
